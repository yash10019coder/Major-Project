This project focuses on enhancing the security and usability of the Züs cryptocurrency platform by implementing a split key wallet protocol and developing a dedicated mobile authenticator. The split key wallet protocol improves key management and reduces the risk of private key compromise by splitting the key into multiple components stored on separate devices. The mobile authenticator provides an additional layer of security for user authentication and transaction signing.

The implementation leverages the BLS signature scheme, which supports key splitting and aggregation, offering improved efficiency compared to other signature schemes like Schnorr and ECDSA. The report presents the methodology, system architecture, and performance analysis of the implemented solution.

The split key wallet protocol and mobile authenticator integration with the Züs platform aim to provide users with a secure and user-friendly experience while managing their digital assets. The project contributes to the overall security and adoption of decentralized storage and cryptocurrency ecosystems.
