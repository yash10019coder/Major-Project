\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
Züs is a decentralized cloud storage platform that aims to provide secure, reliable, and scalable storage solutions while leveraging blockchain technology. The platform introduces a new decentralized finance (DeFi) model based on cloud storage, allowing users to earn steady income by staking their tokens and participating in the storage ecosystem.

\section{Problem Statement}
As the adoption of decentralized storage and cryptocurrency platforms grows, ensuring the security of user assets and providing a seamless user experience become critical challenges. Key management, especially in the context of cryptocurrency wallets, poses significant risks, as compromised private keys can lead to the loss of funds. Additionally, the lack of user-friendly authentication mechanisms can hinder the widespread adoption of these platforms.

\section{Objectives}
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement a split key wallet protocol to enhance the security of private key management in the Züs platform.
    \item Develop a dedicated mobile authenticator to provide an additional layer of security for user authentication and transaction signing.
    \item Evaluate the performance and usability of the implemented solution and compare it with existing approaches.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scope and Limitations}
The scope of this project is limited to the implementation of the split key wallet protocol and mobile authenticator specifically for the Züs platform. The solution may not be directly applicable to other blockchain or cryptocurrency platforms without necessary modifications.

The limitations of the project include the reliance on the security of the underlying cryptographic primitives and the assumption that users will follow best practices in securing their devices and private key components.

\section{Organization of the Report}
