\chapter{Results and Analysis}

\section{Performance Evaluation}
The performance of the split key wallet protocol and mobile authenticator is evaluated in terms of various metrics, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transaction Signing Latency: The time taken to complete the transaction signing process, including the generation of partial signatures and the combination of signatures on the mobile authenticator.
    \item Signature Verification Overhead: The additional computational overhead introduced by the BLS signature verification compared to traditional signature schemes such as ECDSA [7].
    \item Communication Overhead: The network overhead incurred due to the transmission of partial signatures between the primary device and the mobile authenticator.
\end{itemize}

The performance evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of the implemented solution. The split key wallet protocol and mobile authenticator achieve reasonable transaction signing latencies, ensuring a smooth user experience. The BLS signature scheme introduces minimal verification overhead compared to ECDSA, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices [18]. The communication overhead is optimized through the use of compact BLS signatures, reducing the amount of data transmitted between devices.

\section{Security Analysis}
The security of the split key wallet protocol and mobile authenticator is analyzed against various threat models and attack scenarios. The analysis covers the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Key Compromise Resistance: The split key approach significantly reduces the risk of private key compromise, as an attacker would need to breach multiple devices to obtain the complete private key [19].
    \item Signature Unforgeability: The BLS signature scheme provides strong unforgeability guarantees, ensuring that an attacker cannot forge valid signatures without possessing the private key components [20].
    \item Secure Communication: The use of encrypted and authenticated communication channels between the primary device and the mobile authenticator prevents eavesdropping and tampering attacks [21].
    \item Device Security: The implementation relies on hardware-backed keystores and secure enclaves to protect sensitive data, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access even if a device is compromised [22].
\end{itemize}

The security analysis demonstrates the robustness of the implemented solution against various attack vectors. The split key approach and the use of the BLS signature scheme provide a high level of security for user assets. The integration of secure communication protocols and hardware-based security features further enhances the overall security posture of the system.

\section{Usability Evaluation}
The usability of the split key wallet protocol and mobile authenticator is evaluated through user studies and feedback sessions. The evaluation focuses on the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User Experience: The intuitiveness and ease of use of the mobile authenticator interface, including the setup process, transaction approval, and biometric authentication.
    \item Error Recovery: The effectiveness of the error handling and recovery mechanisms in guiding users through common error scenarios, such as device loss or network disruptions.
    \item User Perceptions: The users' perceived security, trust, and confidence in the split key wallet approach and the mobile authenticator.
\end{itemize}

The usability evaluation results indicate a positive user experience, with participants finding the mobile authenticator interface intuitive and easy to navigate. The error recovery mechanisms provide clear guidance and support, enhancing the overall user experience. Users express increased confidence in the security of their assets, appreciating the added layer of protection provided by the split key approach and the mobile authenticator.

\section{Comparative Analysis}
The performance and security of the split key wallet protocol and mobile authenticator are compared against existing key management and authentication solutions in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain. The comparative analysis considers factors such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Key Management Approaches: Comparison with single-key wallets, multi-signature wallets, and threshold signature schemes [23].
    \item Authentication Methods: Comparison with password-based authentication, hardware wallets, and other two-factor authentication schemes [24].
    \item Signature Schemes: Comparison with ECDSA, Schnorr signatures, and other BLS-based implementations [25].
\end{itemize}

The comparative analysis highlights the advantages of the split key wallet protocol and mobile authenticator in terms of enhanced security, usability, and performance. The split key approach offers a balanced trade-off between security and convenience, providing stronger protection against key compromise while maintaining a seamless user experience. The BLS signature scheme demonstrates superior performance and aggregation capabilities compared to traditional signature schemes.
