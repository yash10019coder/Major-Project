\section{Summary}
This project aimed to enhance the security and usability of the Z端s cryptocurrency platform by implementing a split key wallet protocol and developing a dedicated mobile authenticator. The split key wallet protocol improves key management and reduces the risk of private key compromise by splitting the key into multiple components stored on separate devices. The mobile authenticator provides an additional layer of security for user authentication and transaction signing.
The implementation leverages the BLS signature scheme, which supports key splitting and aggregation, offering improved efficiency compared to other signature schemes like Schnorr and ECDSA. The system architecture consists of the Z端s platform, split key wallet, mobile authenticator, and cryptographic library components.
The split key wallet protocol involves key generation, key splitting, component distribution, and transaction signing steps. The mobile authenticator, developed using the Flutter framework, provides secure storage, biometric authentication, transaction signing, and push notification capabilities.
The implementation phase involved smart contract development, wallet integration, mobile authenticator development, and rigorous integration testing. The technologies used include Rust, Solidity, Apache Milagro Cryptographic Library, and hardware-backed keystores for secure storage.
